# Elixir-Advent-of-Code ðŸ¤¶

Hey! Will try to solve advent of code (AOC) using Elixir ðŸ’§ &amp; Livebook ðŸ“š. 

ðŸ“… Advent of Code (AOC) is an Advent calendar of **small programming puzzles** for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Project Installation 

ðŸ“š If you want to use Livebook: 

* Step 1: Install and configure Git with GitHub: ([What is Git and GitHub?](#what-is-git-and-github))
* Step 2: Install Elixir: ([What is Elixir?](#what-is-elixir)).
* Step 3: Install Livebook ([What is Livebook?](#what-is-livebook))
* Step 4: Fork this GitHub Repo.
  * [How to fork a repo...](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
* Step 5: Download the project with GitHub Desktop, by https or by ssh. For example with https:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/IciaCarroBarallobre/Elixir-Advent-of-Code.git
```

* Step 6: Initiallizate Livebook and search the file: AdventOfCode.livemd
  
ðŸ’§ Although we are going to use Livebook, we are going to share the solution in a elixir file too.

## More info

### What is Elixir?

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.
It runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.

### What is LiveBook?

Livebook allows you to write interactive & collaborative code notebooks in Elixir.

Some useful features:

* Interactive documents: Notebooks are documents that mix text, code, and rich output. Share knowledge, explore code, and visualize data using tables, charts, maps, and much more!
* Collaborate as a team: Write code, analyze results, and document your findings together, in realtime.
