# Elixir-Advent-of-Code ðŸ¤¶

Hey! I will try to solve advent of code (AOC) using Elixir ðŸ’§ &amp; Livebook ðŸ“š. 

ðŸ“… Advent of Code (AOC) is an Advent calendar of **small programming puzzles** for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

ðŸ“– In this livebook are indexed all the puzzle completed and its answers: [AOC Index Livebook](./AdventOfCode.livemd).
